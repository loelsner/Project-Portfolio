# Project-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Laura! I graduated from UC Davis with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering in June 2019. Since, I've done a volunteer internship in Nicaragua, and I am currenting a Technical Intern at Applied Research Associates modeling cerebral physiology. 

In this repository I've uploaded
- **Senior Design Progress Reports #1-4:** These document background information, design concept screening, a House of Quality relating user needs and design metrics, verification and validation test procedures, a hazarad analysis with FMEA table,  test results, and Client Report.
- **Senior Design Symposium Poster:** This poster was presented at the Engineering Design Showcase, at which my team won the Sandia Engineering Design Award.
- **BIM 110L SolidWorks Microscope Project:** Assembly drawings and finite element analysis for a simplified "microscope" that I also constructed in the machine lab with lathes, CNC mills, laser cutters, and an abrasive waterjet.
